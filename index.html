    <p> Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers 
        to get their creative flow going at the beginning of the day. 
        The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be about
         when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete 
         one of three common writing challenges. 
         The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of 
         a short story and build upon it. A second option is to use the random 
         paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is 
         to have the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. 
         No matter which of these challenges is undertaken, the writer is forced
          to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph 
          into their writing.</p>

          <p> This is the second paragraph. <strong> using the "Strong" tag</strong>
            you can make your text bold. using tag "b" also works but is outdated.
            We can also <em> italicize</em> by using the "em" tag. using the "i" tag
            also works.
